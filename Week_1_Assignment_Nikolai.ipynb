Meanwhile with python you are able to perform the same tasks but you have to add the necessary libraries in order to do so. For me personally I enjoy the simplicity of R compared to python but that might be because I've become so used to R compared to python. I'm sure as I learn more of python I will begin to understand the capabilities of using it over R. I also note that python is not just used for statistical analysis but for various things so I can't really fault it."
